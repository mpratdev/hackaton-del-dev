Additionally, it can be adjusted with variations of 1 DPI, allowing you to adapt the sensitivity of the Razer Viper V3 Pro to the needs of each player.",
        "As an additional feature to improve performance, the Viper V3 Pro includes the HyperPolling Wireless Dongle, with a higher polling rate, reaching up to 8,000 Hz. This feature provides minimal latency response, synchronizing each movement and click with actions on the screen, even in highly competitive environments.",

        "In its aim to balance battery life without affecting the gaming experience, the Razer Viper V3 Pro is capable of automatically adjusting the polling rate, provided we activate this function. This adjustment makes it possible for the battery to last up to 95 hours on a single charge. Regarding the 3rd generation Razer optical switches, they have a lifespan of 90 million clicks."
